To many, the idea of accessing legal aid after a crime seems like the regular course of action. **It seems normal to demand justice.** However, for countless women in India, demanding justice means airing out your dirty laundry and exposing your wounds to society to ridicule. Besides this, most survivors of gender-based crimes who wish to fight against such atrocities don't know where to seek basic legal aid - Who to approach when the going gets tough. As corroborated by [Brut's documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THBsY9zP2kg), women-right activists, too, struggle with going through newspapers to find new cases, fact-finding and reaching survivors of gender-based crimes. Up to date, they maintain manual registers with cutouts from newspapers. Putting our foot in, this is where we help.

Aiming to bridge this gap between lawyers and victims, our initiative compiles a list of daily newspaper articles mentioning incidents and victims. Through our ML algorithm, we also consolidate unique information about identical cases from different newspapers and provide lawyers and activists assistance with as much information mentioned in media. You can access all such news pieces below.
