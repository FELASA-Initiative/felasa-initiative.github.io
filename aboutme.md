Felasa, or The Feminine Law Safety Awareness Initiative, founded in August 2022, is a forum to create awareness about women's safety laws in India. Our vision entails legally empowering women (both educated and illiterate) ignorant of their rights to access and demand justice.

- We are mainly dedicated to providing a platform to connect women with low access to financial resources to pro-bono lawyers and NGOs. 
- Acknowledging the amount of resources required to build cases which limit the number of women that could be helped, we utilize technology to highlight victims of gender-based crimes. Our algorithm summarizes the information from disparate articles in the media to help lawyers build their cases.
- Through blogs and outreach programs, we are also committed to sensitizing women and girls about their safety rights and laws established under the Constitution of India.
