Many are unaware of the protective laws designed for women in the labyrinth of legalities today. Knowledge is powerâ€”especially for women juggling roles as parents, wives, daughters, employees, and individuals. This article sheds light on ten pivotal laws in India crafted to ensure women's safety.

## 1. No Woman Shall Be Arrested After Sunset & Before Sunrise

**Legal Basis:** Sub-section (4) of Section 46(4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973

Women cannot be arrested between 6 PM to 6 AM without prior permission from a Magistrate, and if mandated, it should only be conducted by a Lady Police Officer.

## 2. Women are Legally Entitled to Long-term Paid Leaves for Miscarriages or Pregnancy-related Complications

**Legal Basis:** Maternity Benefits Act

Women with a minimum of 80 days of employment in the 12 months before their anticipated delivery are eligible for maternity benefits, including maternity leave, nursing breaks, and a medical allowance. The law ensures long-term paid leaves in case of adverse incidents, during which termination is prohibited.

## 3. All Women, Married or Unmarried, Have the Right to Safe Abortion Under Law

**Legal Basis:** The Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act

Every woman, regardless of marital status, has the legal entitlement to a safe abortion, guaranteeing privacy and the freedom to make personal choices. Abortion procedures require explicit consent, and spousal permission is not mandatory.

## 4. Women Have the Right to Take Up an Anonymous Identity for Sexual Assault Victims

**Legal Basis:** Section 228A of the Indian Penal Code

The identity of sexual assault victims must remain confidential, and any disclosure by the police or media is a punishable offense.

## 5. Women Have the Right to Lodge Virtual Complaints

Women can file complaints remotely by sending an email or registered post to a senior police officer of the level of Deputy Commissioner or Commissioner of Police.

## 6. Women Are Protected Against Stalking

**Legal Basis:** Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013

Stalking, both physical and cyber, is a recognized crime, and offenders can face imprisonment and penalties.

## 7. Women Have the Right to Zero FIR

 Women can register a complaint at any police station, and the FIR can later be transferred to the jurisdictional police station.

## 8. Women Have Access to Free Legal Aid

Women have the right to demand and receive free legal aid when seeking police assistance.

## 9. Women Are Protected Against Workplace Harassment

**Mandatory Requirement:** Sexual Harassment Complaints Committee

Every organization, public or private, must establish a committee to address sexual harassment complaints, with at least 50% of its members being women.

## 10. Women Have the Right to Privacy During Statement Recording

**Legal Basis:** Right to privacy during statement recording

Women who have experienced rape have the right to privacy when recording their statement, allowing them to do so in front of a magistrate or a lady constable in a private setting.
